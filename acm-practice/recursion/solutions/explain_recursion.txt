This answer has came from an old officer from the ACM-W club. Thank you Sara Lipowsky for your great answer to this question.

One way of being able to explain recursion to a child is by comparing it to waiting in line for their lunch at the cafeteria. When a child is waiting in line for their food, the main thing that is on their mind is how many people do they have to wait for until they can get their meal.

So, you can explain to the child that an example of recursion is when they ask the person in front of them how many children are ahead of them in line? That child would then ask the child in front of them, how many children are in front of them. This would keep going until it gets to the very first child in line. Once the first child receives the question, they can respond to the child behind them that there are zero children in front of them. The child who just received the news can now tell the previous child that there is one child in front of them. The child who received the news can now update the previous child that there are two children in front of him. This will keep continuing until it gets back to the original child asking, and the child would get their question answered.

Being able to take complex concepts like recursion and breaking it down into something easily digestible can be one of the toughest questions you may receive in job interviews. It can test if you are a student who actually understood the material, or a student that memorized the coding, just to pass through the class. If you are able to answer this with all major C++ concepts, it can definitely help you better your chances during an interview in the long run.
